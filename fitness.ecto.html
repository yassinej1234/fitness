    <h2 class="ecto">ECTOMORPH WORKOUT PLAN – GETTING STARTED</h2>
    <ol class="p"><li><p class="ecto">If you’re new to training, then we have the perfect ectomorph working plan that is ideal for beginners and those with more experience. Some of the most common mistakes that ectomorphs make is not having a diverse enough workout plan, not getting enough sleep, overtraining and not having a specific goal in place. This workout is easy to follow and it will help you get the results you need. You will need to choose a main chest exercise, main back exercise and a main leg exercise. You can then mix them up for a routine.</p></li></ol>

    <ol class="p"><li><p class="ecto">Aim for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps. Make sure you eat or drink some protein and carbohydrates around 30-60 minutes before exercise. Ectomorphs tend to get tired more easily which means you require the extra energy to make the most of the workout. Don’t forget to keep up your hydration during the workout. You should then have a post workout meal around an hour later. This will give your muscles the nutrition they need to repair and rebuild.</p></li></ol>

    <h2 class="ecto">BEST DIET FOR ECTOMORPH TRANSFORMATION</h2>
    <ol class="p"><li><p class="ecto">As well as exercises, diet is very important for an ectomorph. The fast metabolism means that it is harder for an ectomorph to gain serious weight. Additionally, gaining weight too quickly can lead to fat in the stomach area rather than being evenly distributed. Also, metabolism usually catches up which means you should plan ahead with a healthy diet otherwise you risk getting unhealthy levels of body fat in your later years.
        <br><br> Aim for 50/60% of your calories to come from carbohydrates, 25% from protein and 25% from healthy fats. Eat regular meals and ensure you are on a caloric surplus. This means intaking around 250-500 calories above your maintenance. In general, ectomorphs need more calories and more carbohydrates than those with other body types. Make sure your diet is packed with fruits, vegetables and nutrient dense snacks such as nuts and seeds. Many ectomorphs fall into the trap of eating anything regardless of how unhealthy it is. But, remember that your fast metabolism won’t be around forever.
